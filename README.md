# My Portfolio

This site was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React Library. I made this portfolio project as an exercise to learn React for the first time. At first, I felt like React was overcomplicating a lot of concepts, but I soon realized its effectiveness in dynamic programming. It's as if I've discovered a for loop for writing complex containers filled with many elements and various styles. This is just one step in my journey to learn more concepts and have better practice in both front-end in back-end development.
